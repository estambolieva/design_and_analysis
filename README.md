"# design_and_analysis of alogirthms - Coursera Stanford course"

1. week 1 - 2 commits
   a. 1st commit - mergeSort implemented
   b. 2nd commit - inversions counted implemented
   
2. week 2: QuickSort.py - 3 commits
   a. 1st commit - randomized quickSort
   b. 2nd commit - deterministic quickSort
   c. 3rd commit - deterministic quickSort exactly as lecture notes instructed, solving problem 1

   QuickSort_last.py - 2 commits
   a. 1st commit - quickSort. pivot is the last element. reserve algorithm - starts from the end of the array and traverses to its beginning
   b. 2nd commit - quickSort. pivot is the last element. 
   c. 3rd commit - quickSort. problem 2 solved. pivot is the last element in the array, it is swapped with the first one and then follows the final implementation in QuickSort.py

   QuickSort_median.py - 1 commit
   a. 1st commit - quickSort. pivot is the median of three. pivot is swapped with the firt element of the array. implementation follows QuickSort.py

3. week3: rSelect_randomized.py
   a. 1st commit - randomized rSelect. Gets the i-th order statistics of an unosrted array
